# Snake_game_using_python

Snake game is one of the oldest arcade games that still now exists and can be found in mobile phones ranging from keypad ones to the smartphones.

It is the simple 2-D snake game created on python using pygame.

We changed the standard snake game into a more exiting one, we added new rules along with randomly obstacle generating level. Our game consists of 4 levels each level having its own rules and conditions to meet, satisfying this the game proceeds to the next level.
